Operators

1) Write a C# program to swap two numbers without using a third variable.
(Hint: Use arithmetic or bitwise operators)

Given int a = 5, b = 10;

2) Find the result of:

a + b * 2

(a + b) * 2

b % a

Print each result.

3) Take an integer input from the user and check if it is even or odd using the % operator.

4) Take three integers as input and find the largest number using only relational (>, <) and logical operators (&&, ||).

5) Write a program to toggle the case of a character using a bitwise operator.
(Hint: XOR with 32 works for alphabets)




If-Else

1) Write a program that takes a number from the user and prints:

"Positive" if it’s greater than 0

"Negative" if it’s less than 0

"Zero" if it equals 0

2) Take the marks of a student (0–100).

If marks ≥ 50 → Print "Pass"

Else → Print "Fail"

3) Ask the user to enter their age.

If age < 18 → Print "Not eligible to vote"

Else → Print "Eligible to vote"

4) Write a program to check if a year is a leap year using if-else.
(Hint: A year is leap if divisible by 4 but not 100, or divisible by 400





Else If (Ladder)

1) Take marks of a student and assign Grades:

Marks ≥ 90 → "A"

Marks ≥ 75 → "B"

Marks ≥ 60 → "C"

Marks ≥ 40 → "D"

Else → "Fail"

2) A shop gives discounts:

If bill ≥ 5000 → 20% discount

If bill ≥ 2000 → 10% discount

If bill ≥ 1000 → 5% discount

Else → No discount
Calculate and print final amount.

3) Take an integer (1–7) and print the day of the week (1 → Monday, …, 7 → Sunday). Use else if.

4) Write a program to take three angles of a triangle as input.

If sum = 180 → "Valid Triangle"

Else → "Invalid Triangle"

5) Electricity bill calculation:

For first 100 units → ₹5 per unit

Next 100 units → ₹7 per unit

Above 200 units → ₹10 per unit
Take units consumed and calculate the bill.
