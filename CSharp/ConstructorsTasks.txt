1) Create a class Book with two properties: Title and Author. Use a constructor to initialize these properties and print the book details.

2) Write a program where a class Student has a constructor that takes id and name as parameters. Create multiple objects and display their details.

3) Create a class Circle with a constructor that initializes the radius. Add a method to calculate the area and print it.



4)Write a class Car with a default constructor (no parameters) and a parameterized constructor. Demonstrate constructor overloading.

5) Create a class Employee with properties Name, Salary, and Department.

Use a constructor to initialize all three.

Create another constructor that initializes only Name and Salary (default department = "HR").

6) Write a program that demonstrates copy constructor in C#. Example: Copy details of one Person object to another.



7) Create a class BankAccount that has a static constructor to print "Welcome to XYZ Bank" once when the first object is created.

Demonstrate how constructor chaining works in C#:

8) A class Laptop should have three constructors:

One that sets only Brand.

One that sets Brand and Model.

One that sets Brand, Model, and Price.
Use this() keyword for chaining.

9) Write a program that creates a class Shape. Make Rectangle and Square inherit from Shape. Show how base class constructors are called from derived class constructors.

10) Create a class Game where the constructor throws an exception if the playerâ€™s age is less than 12. Handle the exception gracefully.
